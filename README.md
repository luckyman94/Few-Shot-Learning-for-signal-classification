### Few-Shot Learning on Multichannel Signals  
### Project for the *Deep Learning & Signal Processing* course  
### MVA — ENS Paris-Saclay (Thomas Courtat)

This repository contains the notebooks developed for the few-shot learning project of Thomas Courtat’s course (MVA – ENS Paris-Saclay).  
The goal is to train an encoder on a set of source classes and evaluate its ability to recognize **new, unseen classes** using only **k examples per class**.

Data analysis, the tested models, prototype construction methods, and visualizations (t-SNE, confusion matrices) are detailed in the notebooks.
